# hosting bolt

since bolt's codebase is fairly simple, it's pretty easy to run an instance for
yourself. you can use either [docker (recomended)](./docker.md) or [deno](./deno.md).
after you setup an instance, you may want to [configure it](./configure.md) or run
[database migrations](./migrations.md). need help? take a look at those pages or 
join one of the support servers linked on the [main page](../index.md), where you 
can also find a changelog.

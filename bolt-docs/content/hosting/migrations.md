# database migrations

between different versions of bolt, the way the database has been setup has changed
signifigantly, and to account for differences, the `bolt migration` command in the
cli should let you migrate between versions. if you need help, join the support server.
the latest version listed in that tool is the one you should use with the latest version
of bolt. a list of versions and which db version you can use is below:

| Label    | Versions    |
|----------|-------------|
| Four     | <= 0.4.12   |
| FourBeta | 0.4.0-0.5.0 |
| Five     | >= 0.5.0    |

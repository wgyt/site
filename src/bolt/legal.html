        We try to protect your information as best as we can. We do not share
        your information with third parties unless needed to provide Bolt. If
        you allow us to share your information with other third parties, we may
        share your information with those third parties. If we learn that we

        information immediately and to the extent possible. If we are made aware

      <h2>Government Agencies and Law Enforcement</h2>
      <p>
        Government Agencies and Law enforcement agencies may request that we
        share information with them, and we want to balance user privacy and
        government requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we receive a request from a Government Agency to share data, we
        will carefully review the request to ensure it follows the laws of all
        applicable jurisdictions. Additionally, we will only provide the
        information necessary to comply and only if it is not a privacy risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we believe that we can prevent or reduce the risk of harm by sharing
        information with Government Agencies, we may share information with
        those agencies. We still review these requests to make sure they comply
        with our policies and applicable laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we get a request from a Government Agency regarding you, we will
        notify you as soon as possible unless legally prohibited. We will not
        notify you if a request is related to an emergency until after the
        emergency has passed.
